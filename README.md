# dotenv-keyvault-example

This example uses `dotenv-keyvault` to retrieve a secret value from Key Vault and return it as part of the HTTP response of the function.

## Setup


1. run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. copy `.env-example` to a file called `.env`
3. update `.env` so that it contains a valid URL to a Key Vault secret. You can find the url of your secret using the Azure Portal.
